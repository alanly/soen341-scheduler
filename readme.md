SOEN 341 Term Project
=====================

This repository is intended to hold the contents of the term project for the Winter 2013 semester course of SOEN 341 at [Concordia University](http://www.concordia.ca/).

Project Overview
----------------
The project involves the development of a scheduling application for students of the Software Engineering program at Concordia University. The application automagically puts together a schedule of one semester or an entire academic year, based upon the constraints and preferences of the student (i.e. weekday preferences and time constraints) as well as details from their personal academic records (i.e. courses completed, pre-requisites, etc.)
